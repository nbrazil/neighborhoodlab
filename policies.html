</p>
<p>This page provides information on the lab’s culture, how to join the
lab, and the general workflow for starting up and working on project
tasks.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

</div>
<div id="lab-culture" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Lab Culture</strong></h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The culture of the Neighborhood Inequality Lab is collaborative,
inclusive, supportive, and free from discrimination. Our community has
high standards for rigor, quality, and ethics, and supports each other
to reach these objectives. Because the concept of a lab culture is
“squishy”, below are distinguishing features of our lab’s culture.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have mutual respect for all lab members. This is demonstrated by
accomplishing tasks by the agreed upon deadlines, starting/ending
meetings at the scheduled time, and being prepared to discuss and
engage, which includes drafting agendas if moderating a discussion. This
is also demonstrated by practicing active listening, and not dominating
conversations.</li>
<li>Mutual respect is also demonstrated by providing respectful, honest
input to all team members, and being open to receiving input from others
regardless of level/position.</li>
<li>Mutual respect also means being understanding of others. We are
coming from different life stages and backgrounds, and are dealing with
different life stressors. We are compassionate to lab members, and treat
each other with grace and empathy.</li>
<li>We also are compassionate to ourselves. We strive for quality and
rigor, but also balance that with self-compassion when times get
tough.</li>
<li>Part of being compassionate to yourself and to others is to ask for
help, and to offer help when you can. This includes asking//providing
help for all aspects of the research process, including data analysis
and writing, and career advice. Be present during meetings and
gatherings, respond to inquiries when someone posts a question or
expresses a need, and check in with each other, especially when you know
someone may be going through a stressful experience.</li>
<li>The lab is highly multidisciplinary. This is intentional because
Dr. Brazil’s academic and career background is multidisciplinary, and he
believes the types of issues and problems the lab addresses require a
multidisciplinary approach. Part of understanding others is to not only
respect others’ disciplinary orientations, but use this to our advantage
in terms of broadening our development as social science scholars and
practitioners.</li>
<li>We do not promote a culture of overwork. Professor Brazil does not
expect members to be working in the evenings or on weekends, and asks
that members respect all lab members’ evening and weekend time as well.
This includes not expecting members to review your work product, or
otherwise be available for typical work tasks outside business
hours.</li>
<li>Have fun. Make jokes. Laugh. Yes, always strive to be professional
with one another, but also make room to connect with other lab members,
being respectful of their boundaries.</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

</div>
</div>
<div id="joining" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Joining</strong></h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are multiple ways you can join the group.</p>
<ul>
<li>Graduate student
<ul>
<li>Professor Brazil hires you as a Graduate Student Researcher.</li>
<li>Professor Brazil is your major advisor or co-advisor.</li>
<li>Professor Brazil is on your dissertation/thesis committee, and your
research interests align with the types of projects supported by the
lab.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Undergraduate student
<ul>
<li>Professor Brazil hires you as a Research Assistant.</li>
<li>You work on one of the lab’s projects voluntarily, enrolled for
credit, or to fulfill your internship requirements.</li>
<li>Professor Brazil is your senior thesis advisor, and the project is
aligned with the types of projects supported by the lab.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>For more details on how to join, see guidelines and advice summarized
<a href="">here</a>. Note that because of limited space, limited
resources or lack of fit, the lab may not be able to bring you in as a
member.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

</div>
<div id="general-workflow" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>General Workflow</strong></h3>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Once it is settled that you are joining the lab, below is an outline
of the general workflow for setting yourself up in the lab. Fuller
details for many of these steps are provided in the rest of this
guide.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Decide on which project to work on (if not recruited by Professor
Brazil to work on a specific project). This will involve taking one or
more of the following actions: talking to Prof. Brazil and other lab
members, reading project material, and attending project meetings.</li>
<li>For undergraduates, decide whether to be involved in the project as
a paid Research Assistant, enrolled for credit, to fulfill internship
requirements, or to fulfill an Honors thesis or some other research
program (e.g., McNair).</li>
<li>Meet with Professor Brazil to set expectations and goals, ask
questions, and iron out logistics. He will also likely recommend reading
some material to get yourself further acquainted with the project.</li>
<li>Get access to and acquaint yourself with the Google shared drive
project folder.</li>
<li>Download Slack, and join the lab’s Slack group. Introduce yourself
to everyone in the general channel.</li>
<li>If you would like access to the lab office space, indicate so during
your initial meeting with Professor Brazil. You will need to fill out a
form, and get the key from the department’s office administrator.</li>
<li>You will get a calendar invite for the regularly scheduled meetings
for the quarter. Accept the invite to acknowledge your receipt.</li>
<li>As a paid GSR or RA, you will be required to go through various
online, self-paced webinars. These will cover various subjects,
including cyber security and research ethics. Paid RAs are expected to
log their hours in a timesheet they submit every two weeks.</li>
<li>Start the project! See the Project Workflow section below.</li>
</ol>
<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="lab-space" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Lab Space</strong></h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Neighborhood Inequality Lab has it’s own office space located in
Hart Hall. The space has two desktop computers, a printer, two desks,
chairs, bookshelves, white board, coffee and tea maker, and snacks. If
you would like to access the lab space, indicate so to Professor Brazil,
and he will set you up with the office administrator. You will have
access to the lab during business hours, but note that you will likely
be sharing the lab space with other members, so please coordinate with
them if the space becomes too congested. Also note that the key is for
the office space. There is a separate key for the building doors, which
close after 6 pm. If you would like to use the lab after business hours,
you can stay in the lab, but you can’t leave the building and come back
in. There is also a break room located on the first floor that you have
access to.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to use the space appropriately, being
respectful to other lab members who use the space, as well as those
occupying offices on the same floor. Please keep the office clean, and
avoid being loud. If there is any issues with the lab, which includes
identifying something that the lab space needs, please let Professor
Brazil know.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

</div>
</div>
<div id="communication" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Communication</strong></h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you are part of a lab research project, you will work closely with
Professor Brazil. For some projects, you may work with a much larger
team, with members ranging across undergraduate to masters to PhD level.
As such, efficient and clear communication between members is vital to
ensure success and engagement.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

</div>
<div id="slack" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Slack</strong></h3>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When you join the lab, you will be expected to join the neighborhood
inequality lab Slack platform. We use Slack because it’s free, has many
easy to use messaging features, and all the cool kids are using it.
Access Slack either through your cell phone, desktop or online internet
browser. If you don’t already have slack, download it <a
href="https://slack.com/">here</a>, and you will get an invite from
Professor Brazil.</p>
<p>Here’s what you will find and do on Slack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post and read about your project. These include
<ul>
<li>A summary of meetings</li>
<li>A summary of next steps</li>
<li>Quick updates</li>
<li>Project related questions that are relevant to all team members</li>
<li>Scheduling meetings</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Read about and contribute to what lab members are doing in other lab
projects</li>
<li>Post, read and contribute to questions open to every lab member
about
<ul>
<li>code, data wrangling, data analysis, writing or anything related to
the the research process</li>
<li>classes, graduate programs, and other career-related topics</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Post and read about announcements for jobs, grants and fellowships,
seminars, conferences</li>
<li>You can also direct message (DM) members to discuss private
issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Slack is organized by channel. Each channel is specific to the lab
project. There is also a channel for code and data analysis related
posts (e.g., how can I do this in R? Which spatial model should I run?),
announcements (E.g., job postings, when our next end of the quarter
celebrations are), and general posts. You can allow for notifications if
someone posts, or DMs you. Please make an effort to respond to messages
that message you as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Of course, <em>using</em> Slack is voluntary. And if you find
yourself writing a really long post, perhaps it is better to send an
email, or wait to ask your question during a meeting. Professor Brazil
will communicate through both email and Slack.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

</div>
</div>
<div id="meetings" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Meetings</strong></h3>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You are expected to meet with team members as a group on a regular
basis. Depending on how many team members, and your specific
responsibilities, you may also need to separately meet with some
members. Usually, full team meetings are held every week, especially at
the beginning of the project, but this may change depending on the
broader project tasks. For example, we will likely meet every week
during data wrangling and data analysis, but less regularly during the
writing stage, and potentially not at all for awhile when a paper is
submitted for journal peer review. Regularly scheduled are usually set
at the beginning of each quarter, with the understanding that days/times
may change.</p>
<p>Meetings typically involve going through updates from each members,
addressing questions and concerns, and establishing next steps. There’s
also always time set aside at the beginning of each meeting for general
updates, questions, and the sharing of
stories/haikus/sonnets/op-eds.</p>
<p>Professor Brazil prefers to have meetings in person at his office as
the default, with the option to meet on Zoom given changes in schedules
and other unexpected occurrences, such as travel or a minor illness like
a modest cold (if major, you should not meet at all). However, several
students do not live locally, or have other life circumstances that make
it difficult to meet regularly in person, so we hold Zoom-only meetings
for some projects.</p>
<p>If you have a question that is preventing you from moving forward
with your task, do not save it for the team meeting, but reach out to
the team, or Professor Brazil directly. He will either address it via
email/slack, or ask to meet with you if the issue is difficult to
address through email/slack.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

</div>
<div id="advising-on-your-work" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Advising on your work</strong></h4>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you are a student meeting with Professor Brazil to ask questions
about your dissertation/thesis or a research project separate from those
conducted in this lab, please adhere to following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send an email providing context for your project. Some questions can
be addressed by email instead of an in person meeting.</li>
<li>If a meeting is needed, give Professor Brazil enough time
flexibility to schedule one (e.g., do not ask just to meet that
afternoon or the next day, with no other options), unless it is urgent
(e.g., I need to send a draft of my thesis to the committee, but I need
your feedback).</li>
<li>Send relevant material well in advance of the meeting, preferably no
less than 5 days before the meeting. This may be the draft of your
dissertation/thesis, or a few paragraphs providing context to your
questions.
<ul>
<li>If you send material close to the meeting date, do not expect
Professor Brazil to thoroughly read the material.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Send a written agenda for the meeting through email before the
meeting, even if it is a few hours in advance.</li>
<li>The reasons why we want you to provide the materials outlined above
is so that we can be efficient with our time during the meeting, which
includes Professor Brazil providing you the best possible and informed
advice.</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="project-workflow" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Project Workflow</strong></h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Lab projects are primarily quantitative. This means that you will
likely be involved in tasks throughout the data analysis process. You
will also likely be involved in non data analysis tasks, such as reading
papers, literature reviews, writing up summaries, contributing to
manuscripts intended to be published in peer-review academic journals,
which includes writing but also formatting and adding references, and
helping present results through PowerPoint presentations, StoryMaps, web
maps, etc.</p>
<p>The types of specific tasks and quantitative methods you will employ
will depend on the project. But below are project workflow components
that are generally common to all projects.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

</div>
<div id="folder-management" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Folder Management</strong></h3>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We use Google Drive to store all project related documents, including
data, code and analysis output. As a UC Davis student, you have access
to a lot of memory space on Google drive. You can access it through your
web browser. But we will ask you to download Google Drive for your
desktop (see <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/download/">here</a>).
This will allow you to access Drive folders through your computer’s
management system. This will also allow you to use directly link R to
shared folder data by setting your working directory directly to the
shared drive.</p>
<p>Although each project is unique, you will find the following folders
associated with the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>References: Papers and reports conducted by other researchers on
subjects informing/relevant to the project</li>
<li>Data: Raw and cleaned data files</li>
<li>Code: R scripts</li>
<li>Results: Tables, maps, graphs, and modelling results.</li>
<li>Writing: Documents summarizing project findings, including
manuscripts being prepared for submission to a peer-reviewed
journal.</li>
<li>Presentations: Documents related to presentations of our project
(e.g., at conferences)</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

</div>
</div>
<div id="codedata" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Code/Data</strong></h3>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We use the statistical program R for all data wrangling and analysis
tasks. A few best practices with data and code management:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you download raw data, save it to the appropriate folder, and
always wrangle it through R scripts. Never overwrite the original file.
Once it is cleaned, save it as a new file</li>
<li>Rather than dumping all the files in one single Data folder, create
sub-folders within the data folder organized by type. For example, one
folder could be demographics, another folder is for another distinct
type of data (e.g., crime).</li>
<li>We use R Scripts for data wrangling. We may also use them for the
exploratory and modelling stages of the project. We use R Markdowns when
we need to present results, such as a set of graphs and descriptive
statistics in the exploratory data analysis stage.</li>
<li>Always start your R Code with a a file header that provides a brief
summary of what it is doing. Indicate yourself as the author, and put
the date you first created, and another date for when you last edited.
And always provide comments to each line of your code. An example of a
file header is shown below</li>
</ul>

<li>Other team members will likely use your code, including members that
join the team after you’ve left, so it is important to comment. If you
go into someone else’s code to edit/change something, add the edit date,
and indicate what changes you made (put your initials).</li>

<h3><strong>Remote High Performance Computing</strong></h3>

</p>
<p>Some tasks based on the size of the data and the memory intensity of
the statistical models may require memory space beyond what is offered
in your personal computer or the lab computers. In this case, you can
access UC Davis <a
href="https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/remote-high-performance-computing/">High
Performance Computing (HPC)</a>. This will allow you to store data and
run models through a remote cluster, which is as a group of
interconnected computers that work together to perform computationally
intensive tasks. The cluster you will access depends on which college
you are affiliated with. Because Professor Brazil is affiliated with the
College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences (CAES), he access the
<a href="https://hpc.ucdavis.edu/farm-cluster">FARM cluster</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Presentations</strong></h3>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It is likely that project findings will be presented to an audience
outside of your project team at some point during the project. This
includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will present results to the lab group to get feedback and
reaction.</li>
<li>We will present results at a professional conference. This is
usually a PowerPoint presentation, but also can be a <a
href="https://urc.ucdavis.edu/creating-effective-academic-posters">poster</a>.</li>
<li>Undergraduates are expected to present at the yearly UC Davis <a
href="https://urc.ucdavis.edu/conference">undergraduate research
conference</a>, which involves putting a poster together and presenting
it at an hour long session.</li>
<li>If you are a graduate student doing a research rotation or research
units with Professor Brazil, then you will present results to your
program’s committee for the former, or to the lab for the latter.</li>
</ul>

<div id="publishing" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Publishing</strong></h3>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It is expected that project findings will be written up for
publication in a <a
href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/oet/ed/stats/03-700.html">peer-reviewed
academic journal</a>. You will be included as a co-author on the paper
as long as you substantively contribute to the project. Although this
will discussed by team members based on the project, guidelines on what
determines inclusion in authorship can be found <a
href="https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html">here</a>.
In general, authorship is based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work;
or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work;
AND</li>
<li>Drafting the work or revising it critically for important
intellectual content; AND</li>
<li>Final approval of the version to be published; AND</li>
<li>Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring
that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the
work are appropriately investigated and resolved.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will discuss authorship early in the research process and have
continuing conversations regarding team member roles.</p>
<p>When we select journals for publication, we will prioritize
publishing in journals that offer an Open Access option. However, we
realize that sometimes the most appropriate journal for a particular
paper will be one that does not offer this option. The UC system
provides a relatively generous option for covering open access fees.
However, when this funding is not available for open access publication
fees, Dr. Brazil will cover these fees using unrestricted funds when
possible.</p>
